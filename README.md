This repository consists of all of my deep learning experiments that has been undertaken by me till date. The repo. will be kept up to date with all the necessary changes in the due course of time.

My concept of the technology is that if we are exposed to different techniques within the technology itself then its more feasible for the general public as well as the researchers to come up with better and faster solution & this repo. is my effort to facilitate that concept.
