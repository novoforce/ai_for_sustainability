    "A function performs an action using some set of input parameters. Not all functions are applicable to all kinds of data. Classes are a way of grouping together related data and functions which act upon that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a kind of data type, just like a string, integer or list. When we create an object of that data type, we call it an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some other languages some entities are objects and some are not. In Python, everything is an object – everything is an instance of some class and the type can be checked by \n",

    "```\n",
    "The data values which we store inside an object are called attributes, and the functions which are associated with the object are called methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "> When we design our own objects, we have to decide how we are going to group things together, and what our objects are going to represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we write objects which map very intuitively onto things in the real world. For example, if we are writing code to simulate chemical reactions, we might have Atom objects which we can combine to make a Molecule object. However, it isn’t always necessary, desirable or even possible to make all code objects perfectly analogous to their real-world counterparts.\n",

    "\n",
    "We start the class definition with the class keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. We would list any parent classes in between round brackets before the colon, but this class doesn’t have any, so we can leave them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the class body, we define two functions – these are our object’s methods. The first is called __init__, which is a special method. When we call the class object, a new instance of the class is created, and the __init__ method on this new object is immediately executed with all the parameters that we passed to the class object. **The purpose of this method is thus to set up a new object using data that we have provided.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is a custom method which calculates the age of our person using the birthdate and the current date.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:**  __init__ is sometimes called the object’s constructor, because it is used similarly to the way that constructors are used in other languages, but that is not technically correct – it’s better to call it the initialiser. There is a different method called __new__ which is more analogous to a constructor, but it is hardly ever used.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that both of these method definitions have self as the first parameter, and we use this variable inside the method bodies – but we don’t appear to pass this parameter in. This is because whenever we call a method on an object, the object itself is automatically passed in as the first parameter. This gives us a way to access the object’s properties from inside the object’s methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should be able to see that our __init__ function creates attributes on the object and sets them to the values we have passed in as parameters. We use the same names for the attributes and the parameters, but this is not compulsory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The age function doesn’t take any parameters except self – it only uses information stored in the object’s attributes, and the current date (which it retrieves using the datetime module).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the birthdate attribute is itself an object. The date class is defined in the datetime module, and we create a new instance of this class to use as the birthdate parameter when we create an instance of the Person class. We don’t have to assign it to an intermediate variable before using it as a parameter to Person; we can just create it when we call Person, just like we create the string literals for the other parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that defining a function doesn’t make the function run. Defining a class also doesn’t make anything run – it just tells Python about the class. The class will not be defined until Python has executed the entirety of the definition, so you can be sure that you can reference any method from any other method on the same class, or even reference the class inside a method of the class. By the time you call that method, the entire class will definitely be defined.\n",

    "You can use functions by themselves, in what is called a procedural programming approach.\n",
    "However, while a procedural style can suffice for writing short, simple programs,\n",
    "an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach becomes more valuable the more your program grows in size and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more data and functions comprise your code, the more important it is to arrange them into logical subgroups, making sure that data and functions which are related are grouped together and that data and functions which are not related don’t interfere with each other. Modular code is easier to understand and modify, and lends itself more to reuse – and code reuse is valuable because it reduces development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic OOPS principles\n",
    "The most important principle of object orientation is **encapsulation**: the idea that data inside the object should only be accessed through a public interface – that is, the object’s methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a good idea for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the functionality is defined in one place and not in multiple places.\n",
    "* it is defined in a logical place – the place where the data is kept.\n",
    "* data inside our object is not modified unexpectedly by external code in a completely different part of our program.\n",
    "* when we use a method, we only need to know what result the method will produce – we don’t need to know details about the object’s internals in order to use it. We could switch to using another object which is completely different on the inside, and not have to change any code because both objects have the same interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation is not enforced by the language, but there is a convention that we can use to indicate that a property is intended to be private and is not part of the object’s public interface: we begin its name with an underscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two main types of relationships between classes: **composition** and **inheritance**.\n",
